 # DDL Constraints Using Sales Database

 * Objectives 

This project demonstrates creation and manipulation of a relational database named Sales using MySQL. It focuses on implementing Data Definition Language (DDL)  
The project also showcases database operations such as adding columns, renaming tables, inserting records, updating data, and deleting tables.

Create a database called “Sales” and create a new table named “Orders” in the Sales database with columns: (Order_Id, Customer_name, Product_Category, Ordered_item, Contact_No). Use constraints: Primary Key Unique Not Null 
1. Add a new column named “order_quantity” to the orders table.
2. Rename the orders table to the sales_orders table.
3. Insert 10 rows into the sales_orders table.
4. Retrieve customer_name and Ordered_Item from the sales_orders table.
5. Use the update command to change the name of the product for any row. 
6. Delete the sales_orders table from the database.
