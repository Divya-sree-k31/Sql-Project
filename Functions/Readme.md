# Functions

* Objective

This assignment showcasing the use of Functions.

Define functions in SQL:

In SQL, functions are used to encapsulate reusable logic that performs a specific task. Functions can be scalar functions (return a single value) or table-valued functions (return a table).

Consider the Country table and Persons table that you created earlier and perform the following: 

1. Add a new column called DOB in Persons table with data type as Date. 
2. Write a user-defined function to calculate age using DOB.
3. Write a select query to fetch the Age of all persons using the function that has been created. 
4. Find the length of each country name in the Country table. 
5. Extract the first three characters of each country's name in the Country table. 
6. Convert all country names to uppercase and lowercase in the Country table.
