# Join and Unions

* Objective

This assignment showcasing the use of SQL for Join and Union .

SQL Joins Define:

SQL joins are used to retrieve data from two or more tables based on a related column. They combine rows from these tables into a single result set.

Types of Joins:

INNER JOIN: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN : Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned for the right table.
RIGHT JOIN : Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned for the left table.

SQL Union Define:

The SQL UNION operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows by default.

Consider the Country table and Persons table that you created earlier and perform the following: 

(1)Perform inner join, Left join, and Right join on the tables.

(2)List all distinct country names from both the Country and Persons tables. 

(3)List all country names from both the Country and Persons tables, including duplicates. 

(4)Round the ratings of all persons to the nearest integer in the Persons table.
